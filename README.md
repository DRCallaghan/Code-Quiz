# <Code-Quiz>

## Description

This code quiz is a basic test of a user's javascript knowledge. It was built using vanilla javascript and jquery, alongside the skeleton html and some custom css.

- This is the first time I have ever made my own computer game, and it was a very interesting project because of the setup and design choices I had to make. As an example, during this project I made the decision to sacrifice scalability in favor of ease of access to my html skeleton via jquery hooks.
- In the future, I would like to come back to this and attempt to make a quiz with many different types of questions rather than all multiple choice and all with 4 answer choices. That scalability would be an interesting build project.
- Creating this was very good practice for writing javascript and jquery. I learned quite a bit about how the two language libraries interact, specifically that DOM elements created via vanilla javascript cannot have jquery methods used on them, and vice versa. This issue was especially frustrating given that otherwise, all syntax was perfect.
